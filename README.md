# odin_todo
This is a project done through the Odin Project curriculum. It involves the culmination of all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge thus far. 

## description
TO-DO apps are nothing special but it's a nice way to build upon the formatting, styling and logic that is involved in a small-scale project. 

## details
This application will be simple and straighforward. It will follow the typical site structure that we have established with a header, navbar on the side, and a content section. The header will just have the name of the app. The navbar will contain all the projects defined by the user. The content will display the project as well as it's accompanying task-list.

### ideas
It might be interesting to take this app in a different direction. I thought to remove deadlines in the original app but what if that idea could be expanded upon in some way. Maybe instead of defining projects alone, you define a day and you can organize what you do in a day by dragging and dropping selected projects (or tasks) to fit into timeslots. This would be less inline with the idea of deadlines but moreso routine or habitual actions that you do throughout a day. Maybe not novel, I'm unsure if this is something already integrated into another one of these apps.
